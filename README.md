# Getting Started with Roaster

This is a social sharing app developed with Java Spring Boot framework as backend and React.js as frontend.

## Back end

In the project directory, you can go into backend/src/main/java/com/roaster/roaster and run

### `RoasterApplication.java`

The backend should run in [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) now.

## Front end

In the frontend/ folder, you can run

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. You can interact with the app when both ends are running.
